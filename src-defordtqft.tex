In this chapter we want to give the definition of a topological quantum field theory, or short TQFT. To be able to do this we first elaborate a bit on the symmetric monoidal categories involved in this definition, the cobordism category $\mathbf{Cob}_{n}$ and the vector space category $\mathbf{Vec}_{K}$. For the sake of readability we will not subscript the braiding $\mathsf{B}$, the associator $\mathsf{A}$, the left unit law $\mathsf{L}$ and the right unit law $\mathsf{R}$ of these categories, as it will always be clear from the context which one is meant.
\\
We start with the cobordism category in section \ref{sec:cob} which will occupy the bulk of this chapter. Afterwards, in section \ref{sec:vec}, we discuss the category of vector spaces, yet a bit more briefly. The definition of a TQFT in section \ref{sec:deftqft} is then easy to give.
