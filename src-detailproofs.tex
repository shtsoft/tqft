Here we give the detailed proofs left out in chapter \ref{CHAP:ALTCHARPROPS}. As already announced there we will often suppress the tensor product symbol between objects in diagrams and longer expressions and we will make heavy use of the coherence theorem for (symmetric) monoidal categories. Remember that we often simply write $\sim$ for unique isomorphisms guaranteed by the coherence theorem, possibly indexed by natural numbers like $\sim_{2}$. Again, all diagrams in this chapter are supposed to be commutative unless stated otherwise, as we will often make changes in diagrams and justify why the diagrams still commute without explicitly saying that they commute.
