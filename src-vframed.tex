Now, letting $\bullet_{\mathrm{st}}$ be the object of $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}$ consisting of a single point with the standard $n$-framing - which is the one induced by the identity - we have everything in place to formulate the cobordism hypothesis. A version that is relatively close to the original formulation of Baez and Dolan is the following
\\
\begin{thm}[Cobordism Hypothesis: Preliminary $(\infty,n)$-Categorical Version]
\label{thm:cobhypprelim}
Given a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category ${_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}$, then there is a bijection between the equivalence classes of symmetric monoidal functors 
\begin{align*}
  Z
  \colon
  \mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}
  &\to
  {_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}
\end{align*}
i.e. of framed fully extended ${_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}$-valued TQFTs, and the equivalence classes of fully dualizable objects of ${_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}$ and this bijection is determined by the evaluation functor $Z \mapsto Z(\bullet_{\mathrm{st}})$.
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}[Sketch]
This is a consequence of theorem \ref{thm:cobhypframed} below.
\\
\phantom{proven}
\hfill
$\Box$
\end{prf}
From this we can conclude that $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}$ is the symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category freely generated by a single fully dualizable object. The above formulation differs from the original formulation of Baez and Dolan in some respects, in particular the original formulation is not cast in the language of $(\infty,n)$-categories but in terms of $n$-categories. Using that the homotopy $n$-category of $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}$ is basically ${_{n}}\mathbf{Cob}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}$ we can deduce a version for $n$-categories by regarding an $n$-category ${_{n}}\mathbf{C}$ - as is always done here - as an $(\infty,n)$-category with only trivial morphisms above level $n$. We have
\\
\begin{cor}[Cobordism Hypothesis: Preliminary $n$-Categorical Version]
\label{cor:cobhypncat}
Let ${_{n}}\mathbf{C}$ a symmetric monoidal $n$-category. There is a bijection between the equivalence classes of symmetric monoidal functors
\begin{align*}
  Z
  \colon
  {_{n}}\mathbf{Cob}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}
  &\to
  {_{n}}\mathbf{C}
\end{align*}
i.e. of framed extended ${_{n}}\mathbf{C}$-valued TQFTs, and the equivalence classes of fully dualizable objects of ${_{n}}\mathbf{C}$ and this bijection is determined by the evaluation functor $Z \mapsto Z(\bullet_{\mathrm{st}})$.
\end{cor}
\begin{prf}[Sketch]
This follows from theorem \ref{thm:cobhypprelim} above, basically by making use of the universal property of the homotopy $n$-category.
\\
\phantom{proven}
\hfill
$\Box$
\end{prf}
This $n$-categorical version may seem to be a bit simpler since one does not have to deal with morphisms above level $n$, yet for the proof given in \cite{dfcdc48c} it is necessary to work in the more general language of $(\infty,n)$-categories because this proof uses an induction on $n$: to understand the $(n+1)$-morphisms of $\mathbf{Bord}_{n+1}^{\mathrm{fr}}$ one needs to understand the $(n+1)$-morphisms of $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}$, but these are {\glqq}divided out{\grqq} when passing to the $n$-category ${_{n}}\mathbf{Cob}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}$.
\\
As the symmetric monoidal functors between two symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-categories (and the higher transfors) make up an $(\infty,n)$-category, we can formulate a slightly more elaborate version of the cobordism hypothesis. Remembering that the underlying $\infty$-groupoid of an $(\infty,n)$-category ${_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}$ is denoted by $\mathrm{G}({_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C})$ we can state the following
\\
\begin{thm}[Cobordism Hypothesis: Framed Version]
\label{thm:cobhypframed}
Let ${_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}$ a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category with duals. The evaluation functor $Z \mapsto Z(\bullet_{\mathrm{st}})$ induces an equivalence
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{func}^{\otimes,\mathrm{sym}}
  \left(
    \mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}
    ,
    {_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}
  \right)
  \to
  \mathrm{G}({_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C})
\end{align*}
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}
A detailed sketch of a proof is given in \cite{dfcdc48c}.
\\
\phantom{proven}
\hfill
$\Box$
\end{prf}
We can conclude in particular that $\mathrm{func}^{\otimes,\mathrm{sym}}(\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}},{_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C})$ is an $\infty$-groupoid. This is actually not very difficult to see and a proof is similar to the non-extended case (see theorem \ref{thm:mntiso} in chapter \ref{CHAP:ALTCHARPROPS} in part \ref{part:ordinary}), yet of course more elaborated. The hard part is to show that the induced functor of $\infty$-groupoids is an equivalence.
\\
One might think that theorem \ref{thm:cobhypframed} contains substantially more information than theorem \ref{thm:cobhypprelim} as it describes the whole category of framed fully extended TQFTs with morphisms between them and not only the isomorphism classes of objects. However, as remarked in \cite{dfcdc48c}, the essential information is already contained in theorem \ref{thm:cobhypprelim} and it is rather easy to prove theorem \ref{thm:cobhypframed} from theorem \ref{thm:cobhypprelim} by using some general facts about $\infty$-groupoids.
\\
In \ref{thm:cobhypframed} we have required ${_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}$ to have duals but we could also drop this requirement in the following way. Using that $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}$ has duals, one can use the universal property of $\mathrm{fd}({_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C})$ from theorem \ref{thm:fdsubcat}, that is, the equivalence of $(\infty,n)$-categories
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{func}^{\otimes,\mathrm{sym}}
  \left(
    \mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}
    ,
    \mathrm{fd}
    \left(
      {_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}
    \right)
  \right)
  \to
  \mathrm{func}^{\otimes,\mathrm{sym}}
  \left(
    \mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}
    ,
    {_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}
  \right)
\end{align*}
induced by the the functor in \ref{thm:fdsubcat}. We hence find from \ref{thm:cobhypframed} that $\mathrm{func}^{\otimes,\mathrm{sym}}(\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}},{_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C})$ is equivalent to the underlying groupoid of the category characterizing the fully dualizable objects, i.e.
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{func}^{\otimes,\mathrm{sym}}
  \left(
    \mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}
    ,
    {_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}
  \right)
  &\simeq
  \mathrm{G}(\mathrm{fd}({_{(\infty,n)}}\mathbf{C}))
\end{align*}
