# tqft

The idea of this project is to provide an accessible introduction to topological quantum theories from a category-theoretical perspective.
Especially for physicists.
So far the project consists of

- notes on TQFTs titled [Ordinary TQFTs and Close Encounters of the Higher Kind](https://github.com/shtsoft/tqft/releases/latest/download/paper.pdf) which, if you like, you can cite as [.bib-file](https://github.com/shtsoft/tqft/releases/latest/download/paper.bib)

## Contributing

If you are dissatisfied with anything or have improvements, ideas or whatever feel free to make a pull request.
We are glad about any kind of help.

## TODO

A project is rarely perfect.
This one is not an exception and so some things remain to do:

- improve the whole writing according to [Dreyer's notes on writing papers](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/talks/talk-plmw16.pdf)
- make notation less heavy in some places
- structure proofs more like programs to ease understanding
