This preliminary chapter consists of two sections. In section \ref{sec:highcat} we introduce higher categories. As giving a precise definition of higher categories is rather involved we content ourselves with an informal treatment trying to make clear what a higher category is supposed to be and to provide some intuition. Moreover, we introduce some constructions and properties on this informal level which we need later in the text. Along the way we give some references containing more details for the notions introduced here. Section \ref{sec:mancorn} then is about manifolds with corners which are a generalization of the concept of manifolds with boundary. After introducing the basic concept we discuss how one can define higher cobordisms which are basically cobordisms between cobordisms.
