So far we have given an alternative characterization for TQFTs and have seen what equivalence of TQFTs means. In this section we want to prove some general basic properties of TQFTs. Even though TQFTs become much more difficult with rising dimension, these properties are rather easy to derive from the definition of a TQFT and the results from the previous sections.
