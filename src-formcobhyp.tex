Now with the definition of the corbordism $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}$ at hand we want to formulate the cobordism hypothesis. But before doing so we have to introduce the concept of fully dualizable objects mentioned in the preceding chapter. This is the content of section \ref{sec:fulldual} of this chapter. Then in section \ref{sec:vframed} we formulate the cobordism hypothesis for the framed version of the $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^{\mathrm{fr}}$. With this we can formulate a version of the cobordism hypothesis for more general tangential structures on the cobordisms which is done in section \ref{sec:vyzstruct}. In the final section \ref{sec:vgstruct} we consider an interesting class of tangential structures for which we can give a slightly different description.
