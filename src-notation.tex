With respect to notation we generally follow mathematical convention. However, in order to make the text easier to read and for our convenience we fix some symbols for variables we often use so that we do not have to define the same symbol with the same meaning all the time. These symbols are given in the table at the end of this subsection. Thus if there appear undefined symbols in the text for which it is not immediately clear what they are supposed to mean the reader might have a look at this table. However, there may be more specifications in the text for such a symbol than those in the table, for example a manifold is often also compact.
\\
When we write phrases like {\glqq}we (usually/often) write{\grqq} then this means that the notation is fixed throughout the text. Besides, we often abuse notation a bit, for example by leaving some of the full notation implicit. For convenience we introduce the symbol $\doteq$ to do that. This means that we often write
\begin{align*}
  \text{abusive notation}
  &\doteq
  \text{full notation}
\end{align*}
indicating that we may also use the abusive notation instead of the full notation. Overall, we tried to use a consistent notation in the sense of choosing different symbol styles for different things like $\mathbf{boldface}$ symbols for categories. Last but not least, we mostly tried to keep our notation consistent with the notation in \cite{00000001}.
